# Hci_project

Project of the Human Computer Interaction course, made in <a href='https://www.javascript.com/' target='_blank'>javascript</a> with the <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/' target='_blank'>VsCode</a> IDE. 
<br>The goal of the project (called GLUTEN-HUB) is to design and implement an application to allow celiacs people to browse several restaurants available, see the offered dishes and ingredients in depth. All this done in order to make them feel safer about the quality of what they will eat, without the risk of feel sick. To achieve this, a focus on the ingredients provenience, as well as quality and safety of the offered products was considered inside the application. <br>The project was made with the <a href='https://react.dev/' target='_blank'>React framework</a>, using <a href='https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/' target='_blank'>React Bootstrap</a> for styling and <a href='https://nodejs.org/en' target='_blank'>NodeJs</a> as runtime environment.
